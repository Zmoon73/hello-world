# hello-world

Hiï¼ŒEveryone. I am a middle school teacher and I want to develope a program to help me collect, sort and analyze students' files. With this program, I can improve students' performance in class and exams. I will learn to code in Python step by step to do so. Thank you.
This is a file I try to master how to commit changes.
